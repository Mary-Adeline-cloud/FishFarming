                The areas of Rwanda best suited for cultivation of fish are the
                flat valley bottoms with very gentle slopes, which lend
                themselves to easy construction of ponds. Most existing ponds
                are in such areas. Water supply would not be a constraint.
                Records of air temperatures suggest that in some places the
                temperature of the water may drop below 10째 to 12째C for a
                sufficiently long time to cause mortalities of fish of such
                species as Tilapia rendalli, T. mossambica and T. nilotica,
                although the Mission is not aware of any actual incidents of
                this kind. When water temperatures are below 17째 to 18째C in
                June, July and August, tilapia will not spawn and growth rates
                will be poor. It will, therefore, have to be accepted that
                fingerlings will not be available for three months in the year
                and the main growing season will be from September to the end of
                May.

              <p>
                We aim for the efficiency in fish production in Rwanda. Our
                vision is to boost fish products in Rwanda in hands with the
                focus of presenting poverty and children malnutrition.
